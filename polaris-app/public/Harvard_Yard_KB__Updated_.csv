"Harvard Yard (Overall)",42.373475,-71.118210,"images/harvard_yard_overall.jpg","Welcome to Harvard Yard, the historic heart and oldest part of Harvard University! This iconic green space, sprawling over 22.4 acres, has been the center of Harvard life since the first parcel of land was purchased way back in 1637. It's not just a picturesque quad; it's a bustling crossroads containing most of the freshman dormitories, Harvard's most important libraries like Widener, the beautiful Memorial Church, several classroom and departmental buildings, and even the offices of the University President. The Yard is roughly bounded by Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge Street, Broadway, and Quincy Street, and its perimeter is marked by an iron fence with twenty-seven gates. When Harvard was founded in 1636 by a vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, it wasn't even called Harvard yet! It started as 'New College' with an initial grant of £400, and its purpose was primarily to educate clergy for the new colony. The college was soon located in 'Newetowne,' which was renamed 'Cambrige' in 1638, the same year the College itself was named 'Harvard Colledge' in recognition of a generous bequest from a young Puritan clergyman, John Harvard. He left half his estate and his entire library of about 400 books to the fledgling institution. Over the centuries, Harvard evolved from this small divinity school into the world-renowned research university we know today, with a commitment to diversity in its student body, a far cry from its early days of educating primarily affluent young men."
"Old Yard",42.374581,-71.117554,"images/old_yard.jpg","Right now, we're standing in what's known as the Old Yard, which is the westernmost and truly the most historic section of Harvard Yard. This is where it all began! It opens onto Peabody Street through the famous Johnston Gate and is where you'll find a charming cluster of freshman dormitories, including Massachusetts Hall, Harvard's oldest standing building. The very first piece of land Harvard owned, purchased from Goodman Peyntree in 1637 or early 1638, formed the nucleus of this Old Yard. Imagine the layers of history beneath your feet! Many famous figures have lived in these dorms; for example, JFK lived in Weld Hall, which is just over there. The Old Yard is almost exclusively a first-year residential space, making it a vibrant hub of student life as new students begin their Harvard journey."
"Tercentenary Theatre",42.374291,-71.116306,"images/tercentenary_theatre.jpg","This expansive grassy area right in the center of Harvard Yard is known as Tercentenary Theatre. It's framed by some of Harvard's most iconic buildings: the grand Widener Library to one side, the stately Memorial Church opposite it, the historic University Hall, and the architecturally significant Sever Hall. This isn't a theatre in the traditional sense, but it's certainly a stage for some of Harvard's biggest moments! It's where the annual commencement exercises are held, a truly grand affair where thousands gather to watch graduates receive their diplomas. It's a place of beginnings and endings, as students also gather here for convocations at the start of their Harvard experience. The name itself hints at a grand celebration – likely Harvard's Tercentenary in 1936. Imagine the history this ground has witnessed!"
"Johnston Gate",42.374692,-71.11857,"images/johnston_gate.jpg","This is Johnston Gate, often considered the main and most grand entrance to Harvard Yard, especially into the Old Yard. It stands proudly between Massachusetts Hall and Harvard Hall, facing Harvard Square. Designed by the renowned architect Charles Follen McKim of McKim, Mead, and White in 1889-1890, it was a gift from Samuel Johnson, Class of 1855. There's a well-known Harvard superstition associated with this gate: they say you should only walk through it twice – once on your first day as a student, and once after you've graduated. Any more, and you might not graduate in four years!. The gate itself is a beautiful example of Georgian Colonial Revival style, featuring ornate ironwork and two stone inscriptions. The cross at its apex symbolizes Harvard's early religious roots. The inscription above the gate famously reads: 'ENTER TO GROW IN WISDOM.'"
"Massachusetts Hall",42.374442,-71.118316,"images/massachusetts_hall.jpg","Look at this incredible building – this is Massachusetts Hall, a true icon of Harvard's history! Built between 1718 and 1720, it holds the distinction of being Harvard's oldest still-standing building and the second-oldest academic building in the entire United States. Can you believe it has stood here for over 300 years? For much of its life, it's served a dual purpose: the first three floors house the very important offices of the President of Harvard University. And then, up on the fourth floor, it's actually a freshman dormitory!. Only about 14 very lucky, or perhaps very brave, first-year students get to live there each year, right above the President! They say being a student in Mass Hall is like being a unicorn because there are so few of them. Fun fact: right next to Mass Hall is a tiny structure called the Guard House, which, believe it or not, was once considered the most expensive building per square foot on Harvard's campus, costing the University $57,000!."
"Harvard Hall",42.374834,-71.118231,"images/harvard_hall.jpg","This is Harvard Hall, another building steeped in dramatic history. Now, the building you see before you, which houses classrooms, is actually the *third* iteration of Harvard Hall. The very first one, built in 1642, was originally located over where Grays Hall stands today, but its wooden foundation rotted in the harsh New England winters, and it had to be rebuilt. The second Harvard Hall, rebuilt in 1766 after the original burned down in a devastating fire in January 1764, had quite a story. That fire was a huge loss for the college; it destroyed the entire college library of some 5,000 volumes, including almost all of John Harvard's original donated books – all except for one!. It also housed a valuable collection of Benjamin Franklin's scientific instruments. The story of that one surviving book, 'Christian Warfare Against the Devil, World, and Flesh,' involves a student named Ephraim Briggs. He had, shall we say, 'borrowed' it overnight – which wasn't allowed – to finish a book report. When he returned the next day, he found Harvard Hall in ashes. Legend has it he returned the book to a devastated President, who then promptly expelled him for breaking the rules, though his honesty (and earlier dishonesty) saved a precious piece of Harvard's heritage!. While the tour script mentions President Lowell in this context, historical accounts of the 1764 fire predate President Lowell's tenure (1909-1933); the president at the time of the fire was Edward Holyoke. The detail about legislators from the Mass Bay Colony quarantining in Harvard Hall and one of them knocking over a candle, causing the fire, is also part of its lore."
"University Hall",42.374461,-71.117083,"images/university_hall.jpg","This grand building with the white-granite facade is University Hall, completed in 1815. Its design was quite a statement at the time, being the first to challenge the red-brick Georgian style that had dominated the Yard. Today, it's a major administrative hub, housing the offices of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Dean of Harvard College. But University Hall has also seen its share of student drama! Back in 1766, it was the site of the very first recorded student protest in American history – the famous 'Butter Rebellion'!. As the story goes, students in the sophomore dining hall (then located in University Hall) were served spoiled butter, and things got a bit messy – think a massive food fight!. Apparently, supply chain issues were to blame for the bad butter. The then-President (though the tour script attributes this to President Lowell, who was president much later) supposedly got so irritated he expelled the entire sophomore class, which included a young Ralph Waldo Emerson!. Don't worry, Emerson got back in and did quite well for himself. University Hall is also where the Administrative Board, or 'Ad Board,' meets – that's the disciplinary board for student issues, so it's a building many students hope they never have a reason to visit too formally!."
"John Harvard Statue",42.374461,-71.117218,"images/john_harvard_statue.jpg","And here he is, the man himself – or so you might think! This is the iconic John Harvard Statue, standing proudly in front of University Hall. It's one of the most photographed statues in the entire United States, a real photo-op spot!. Sculpted by Daniel Chester French, who also did the Lincoln Memorial, it's a beautiful bronze work from 1884. However, this statue is famously known as the 'Statue of Three Lies'. Can anyone guess what they might be? First, the inscription reads 'JOHN HARVARD, Founder, 1638.' Lie number one: John Harvard wasn't the founder; he was the first major benefactor whose generous donation of his library and half his estate led to the college being named in his honor. Lie number two: Harvard wasn't founded in 1638, but in 1636. It was *renamed* Harvard College in 1639 (or 1638 by some accounts, marking his bequest). And the third, and perhaps most amusing lie: this isn't actually John Harvard!. Because all known portraits of John Harvard were destroyed in the Harvard Hall fire of 1764, Daniel Chester French had no likeness to work from. So, he chose a handsome Harvard undergraduate at the time, Sherman Hoar (Class of 1882), to be his model. There's a little detail on the side of the statue: the Harvard crest with three books and the word 'VERITAS' – Latin for Truth. Two books are open, but the third is face down. Some say it was too challenging to sculpt, but a more poetic interpretation, possibly intended by French, is that it symbolizes that truth isn't only found in books; sometimes you need to put the books down and experience the world to find it."
"Widener Library",42.373637,-71.116430,"images/widener_library.jpg","Behold, the magnificent Widener Library, an awe-inspiring building that serves as the flagship and centerpiece of the entire Harvard Library system. Opened on June 24, 1915, it houses an incredible collection of around 3.5 million books on-site!. The story behind its creation is both grand and tragic. It was built by Eleanor Elkins Widener in memory of her son, Harry Elkins Widener Jr., a Harvard College graduate of the Class of 1907 and an avid book collector. Tragically, Harry died in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. His mother donated an initial sum, reported in one document as $2 million, to construct this library as his memorial. There's a popular myth that Mrs. Widener stipulated that Harvard students must pass a swim test because her son couldn't swim. However, this story is completely unrelated; the swim test was actually introduced about ten years after her stipulations for the library, and the two tales just got merged over time. Another myth to dispel is that she required the library never to be altered; this is also untrue, as additions like Pusey Library have been connected. One true stipulation was that no brick or stone of the library should ever be removed. The library also contains the Gutenberg Bible, donated by the Widener family in 1944, though it did not belong to Harry himself. Harvard's overall library system, anchored by Widener, is the largest academic library in the world and the third largest library system in the United States, after the Library of Congress and the Boston Public Library, boasting over 17 to 20 million volumes in total."
"Memorial Church",42.374905,-71.116043,"images/memorial_church.jpg","This is the beautiful Memorial Church, standing as a spiritual and commemorative center right here in Tercentenary Theatre. Dedicated in 1932, it's an interdenominational Protestant church, but it welcomes all. It was built because Harvard had outgrown its previous, smaller chapel, Holden Chapel. Memorial Church proudly hosts the longest-running non-denominational Sunday service in the nation. The church itself is a war memorial. When it was built, a plaque was installed 'in grateful memory of the Harvard men who died in the World War,' referring to World War I, as no one at the time imagined there would be a second global conflict. If you go inside, you'll see a larger plaque that now lists all Harvard affiliates who gave their lives in various conflicts throughout the 20th century. It's a place for reflection, worship, and remembrance, right in the heart of the Yard."
"Sever Hall",42.374366,-71.115507,"images/sever_hall.jpg","This striking red-brick building is Sever Hall, designed by the famous architect Henry Hobson Richardson and completed in 1878. It's a classroom building renowned for its Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style and is considered one of the best examples of Richardson's work. In fact, it was once called the most beautiful building in America by a very famous architect!. Sever Hall is also known for a fascinating acoustic feature: the 'whispering arch' at its entrance. If you stand at one end of the arch and whisper, someone at the other end can hear you clearly, a fun little quirk of its design. It stands as a significant academic building within the main quad of Harvard Yard."
"Wadsworth House",42.373391,-71.118127,"images/wadsworth_house.jpg","This charming yellow building, Wadsworth House, is one of the oldest structures on campus, predating even Massachusetts Hall by a few years if considering its original construction period, though Mass Hall is the oldest *still standing continuously used for academic purposes*. Located on the south side of the Yard along Massachusetts Avenue, it was originally built to house Harvard's presidents, starting with President Benjamin Wadsworth in 1726. It has witnessed incredible history! During the American Revolution, it served as General George Washington's first headquarters in Cambridge in July 1775, and he even hosted notable figures like Abigail Adams here. It's said that some of the early plans to strategize against the British in Boston were conceived right within its parlor. While a site of patriotic pride, Wadsworth House also bears witness to a more complex and painful part of Harvard's past: both President Wadsworth and a later resident, President Edward Holyoke, were slaveholders, and enslaved individuals named Titus, Venus, Bilhah, and Juba lived and worked within this very house in the early 1700s. In a move to acknowledge this difficult legacy, former Harvard President Drew Faust dedicated a plaque here to their memory, an important step in recognizing the contributions of enslaved people to the University's history. Today, Wadsworth House holds various administrative offices, including those of the University Marshal and the Harvard University Librarian."
"Weld Hall",42.373930,-71.117125,"images/weld_hall.jpg","This is Weld Hall, one of the historic freshman dormitories in the Old Yard. It has housed many students over the years, but perhaps its most famous resident was John F. Kennedy!. There's a bit of a campus legend that his old room is now where the elevator shaft is, leading to some spooky stories about the ghost of JFK haunting the elevator. There's another fun story associated with Weld Hall and JFK. When he was President, he once gave a speech about the need to revitalize depressed areas. Students in Weld, feeling their dorm was rather run-down at the time, cheekily hung a sign from the building that read, 'Jack, Weld is a depressed area!'. Weld Hall stands as a testament to generations of Harvard student life."
"Matthews Hall",42.374097,-71.118166,"images/matthews_hall.jpg","Welcome to Matthews Hall, another of the freshman dorms nestled here in the Old Yard!. For some tour guides, like the one who wrote the Key Script, Matthews holds a special significance, even if it wasn't their own freshman dorm. They might tell you it's where they spent their very first night as a Harvard undergrad during a pre-orientation program, sleeping in sleeping bags on a suite floor, a memorable start to their college experience!. Matthews has also had its share of notable residents. Actor Matt Damon lived here, and his roommate was James Furman, who later became an Ec10 professor at Harvard. And before him, tech titan Bill Gates also called Matthews Hall home during his time at Harvard."
"Straus Hall",42.374172,-71.118608,"images/straus_hall.jpg","We're now near Straus Hall, one of the dormitories in Harvard Yard, often a stop for tours, perhaps in its courtyard. It's known for housing freshmen, contributing to the vibrant first-year experience in the Yard. While many famous individuals have passed through Harvard's dorms, Straus Hall has a particularly notable former resident from the digital age: Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, lived in Straus during his time at Harvard. Imagine the early ideas for what would become a global social network possibly being brainstormed within these walls!"
"Grays Hall",42.373646,-71.117822,"images/grays_hall.jpg","This is Grays Hall, another of the historic freshman dormitories here in Harvard Yard. According to the tour script, Harvard's very first building, dating back to 1636, was actually constructed right over the site where Grays Hall now stands, making this ground incredibly historic. Grays has also housed some well-known figures; actress Natalie Portman lived in Grays Hall during her undergraduate years at Harvard. One tour guide even jokingly mentioned a friend who lived there and liked to boast about sleeping in the same bed as Natalie Portman!."
"Holworthy Hall",42.375523,-71.117219,"images/holworthy_hall.jpg","Holworthy Hall, built in 1812, is the northernmost of the old dormitories in Harvard Yard and has a rich history. It was named in honor of Sir Matthew Holworthy, a wealthy English merchant whose bequest in 1678 was, at the time, the largest donation in the college's history. When it opened, rent was $26 a year, and for nearly a century, it lacked indoor plumbing, with students having to use the college pump in the Yard!. Room 24 even served as the library for Harvard's Phi Beta Kappa chapter until 1860. Though initially housing students from all classes, it became predominantly a senior dorm by the early 20th century, highly sought after for its historic charm. Famous past residents include Horatio Alger, Thomas Bulfinch, Conan O'Brien, and Al Gore."
"Holden Chapel",42.375271,-71.118123,"images/holden_chapel.jpg","This small, charming building is Holden Chapel, a true gem in Harvard Yard. Completed in 1744, it holds the distinction of being the third oldest building at Harvard and one of the oldest college buildings in all of America. Before the larger Memorial Church was constructed, Holden Chapel served as the primary place of worship for the Harvard community. Its distinctive blue, pentagonal façade makes it quite recognizable. Today, this historic chapel is home to the Holden Choirs, continuing its legacy as a place for community and expression at Harvard."
"Phillips Brooks House",42.375653,-71.117943,"images/phillips_brooks_house.jpg","This is Phillips Brooks House, a building in Harvard Yard that is dedicated to a very important aspect of Harvard life: student service to the community. It serves as the headquarters for the Phillips Brooks House Association, more commonly known as PBHA. PBHA is a remarkable student-run, community-based non-profit organization. It's an umbrella for over 80 diverse programs that engage hundreds of Harvard students in public service, working with communities in Cambridge and Greater Boston on issues ranging from education and mentoring to advocacy and healthcare. Its location in the northwestern corner of the Yard makes it a central point for students committed to making a difference."
