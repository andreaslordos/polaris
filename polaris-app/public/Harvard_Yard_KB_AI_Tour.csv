"Harvard Yard","Welcome to Harvard Yard, the historic heart and oldest part of Harvard's campus, with the first land purchased way back in 1637. It's more than just a beautiful quad; it's a vibrant hub, home to most freshman dormitories, major libraries like Widener, the serene Memorial Church, various academic buildings, and even the University President's offices.","Tell me more","In addition to being part of day-to-day student life, the Yard hosts a number of special events throughout the year, including concerts, social events, and time-honored student traditions such as Housing Day, where first-year students learn what residential house they have been sorted into. In the warmer months, you'll see brightly colored chairs throughout the Yard-these are part of Harvard's Common Spaces initiatives and invite members of the Harvard community and public to share the space.","What was Harvard's original name and purpose?","Harvard was originally founded as 'New College' in 1636. Its primary purpose was to educate clergy for the new Massachusetts Bay Colony."
"Tercentenary Theatre","On most days of the year, Tercentenary Theater serves as a space students walk through on the way from class to class, but on special occasions, it is also a premier University event venue. Dedicated to commemorate Harvard's 300th anniversary in 1936, several of Harvard's largest events happen in the Theater. Two of the most notable ceremonies that happen in this space each year are first-year convocation and the University-wide commencement ceremonies, housing the signature events that bookend the undergraduate experience.","Tell me more about Commencement","While students from all the graduate schools and the college graduate at the same time, diplomas are not handed out during this ceremony. The graduate students return to their graduate schools to receive their diplomas while the undergraduate students receive their diplomas following the yard ceremony at events in their respective houses. Part of Commencement Day is having an invited speaker address the graduating classes. Famous Commencement speakers include former U.S. President John F. Kennedy, renowned talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, the late Congressman John Lewis, and the German chancellor Angela Merkel.","Why is it called Tercentenary Theatre?","The name refers to Harvard's Tercentenary celebration in 1936, marking 300 years since the university's founding. It serves as a symbolic 'theatre' for Harvard's most important moments and celebrations."
"Johnston Gate","Built in 1890, Johnston Gate is the oldest of 25 gates that surround Harvard Yard. Many of the gates surrounding the Yard were donated by Harvard graduating classes in the second half of the 19th century. The area in which Johnston Gate now stands has been the main entrance to Harvard since the 17th century.","What is the superstition associated with Johnston Gate?","The superstition is that students should only walk through Johnston Gate twice: once when they first arrive as students, and once after they have graduated. It's said that passing through it at other times might bring bad luck regarding timely graduation.","What about the little guard house on the side?","That guard house was a source of major controvery when it was built in 1983 - costing over $90,000 to build in today's dollars, in part because of the Administration's indecisiveness over the design. Rumor has it the architect presented over 300 different designs before one was accepted."
"Massachusetts Hall","Built in 1720, Massachusetts Hall is the oldest building still standing on Harvard's campus and the second oldest academic building in the United States (the College of William and Mary in Virginia is the first). This building became an important site of the American Revolutionary War, when students were dismissed early and Harvard's campus was turned over to the Continental Army. Originally used as a dormitory, 'Mass Hall' housed approximately 640 soldiers of the Continental Army under General George Washington during the Siege of Boston.","Who lives here?","Massachusetts Hall has a unique dual role: the first two floors house the very important offices of the President of Harvard University. And then, up on the third floor, it's actually a freshman dormitory for about a dozen students!","Tell me more","While staying in Massachusetts Hall and other campus buildings, soldiers tore off neighboring Harvard Hall's roof-1,000 pounds of metal-to melt into bullets. They also stripped brass doorknobs and interior woodwork out of the buildings to create more supplies. Following the war, in 1778, Harvard petitioned the Massachusetts House of Representatives, listing their losses down to the shilling and pence. The College was awarded the sum of 417 pounds as reimbursement."
"Harvard Hall","This Harvard Hall is the third building in the Yard to be called Harvard Hall. The first Harvard Hall was built in 1644, but rotted on its foundation. The second Harvard Hall was constructed in this current location in 1677, and was considered to be the colonies' most important academic building. It contained state-of-the-art labs, classrooms, a dining hall, and the library. Unfortunately, in 1764, the second Harvard Hall was destroyed by a fire. The College lost nearly its entire book collection in the blaze - of 5,000 volumes, a little more than 400 books survived. All of the books donated to the College by John Harvard were lost. Today, Harvard Hall today contains classrooms and several large lecture halls.","What else was lost?","All of John Harvard's portraits succumbed to the flames, so there is no remaining evidence of John Harvard's appearance. Only one book in the collection survived, but only because it happened to be checked out by a student at the time. The book was 'Christian Warfare Against the Devil World and Flesh,' published in 1634. This sole remaining piece of John Harvard's collection is now housed in Houghton Library.","How was one book saved from the 1764 fire?","The student who inadvertently saved one of John Harvard's books was Ephraim Briggs. Before the fire, it is unclear whether he had received the necessary written permission from the president to take the book out of Harvard Hall. Rumor has it that the next day, after seeing the destruction of Harvard Hall, Ephraim returned the book to President Holyoke and was thanked, then expelled."
"University Hall","This grand building with the white-granite facade is University Hall, completed in 1815. Its design was a significant statement at the time, a departure from the red-brick Georgian style that had previously dominated the Yard. Today, it serves as a major administrative hub for key deans within the university. But University Hall has also witnessed its share of student activism and drama throughout its long history! It was the site of what is considered the very first recorded student protest in American history, known as the Butter Rebellion.","What was the 'Butter Rebellion'?","As the story goes, students in the sophomore dining hall (then located in University Hall) were served spoiled butter, and started a riot (and a food fight) as a result.","Who works here?","University Hall houses the offices of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Dean of Harvard College. It is also where the 'Ad Board' meets – that's the disciplinary board for student issues."
"John Harvard Statue","Here stands the iconic John Harvard Statue, sitting proudly in front of University Hall as one of the most photographed statues in the United States. Made in 1884, the John Harvard Statue was created by Daniel Chester French, who also cast the Lincoln Memorial. It's also known as the 'Statue of Three Lies' because of the statue's inscription, which reads: John Harvard, Founder, 1638.","What are the 'Three Lies'?","The first lie: John Harvard was not the founder, but a benefactor of Harvard College. Originally referred to as the 'new college' in New Towne, the college was renamed in recognition of John Harvard's gifts after its founding. (The City of Cambridge was later renamed after the university city in England.) Next, Harvard was founded in 1636 and not 1638. And lastly, this is not actually a statue of John Harvard. Since all portraits of John Harvard burned with Harvard Hall in the 1760s, Daniel Chester French had no reference for his sculpture created in 1884. Instead, the statue was cast in the image of Sherman Hoar-a distant relative of the third president of Harvard, Congressman Leonard Hoar","Is that Harvard's crest on the side?","Yes! The statue also features a version of Harvard's traditional Veritas Crest on the side. Veritas, the Latin word meaning truth, is Harvard's motto. It can typically be found written across three open-facing books. However, on the statue, the third book is facing down. There are historic and religious interpretations of this placement, but some Harvard students today see it as a reminder to put books down occasionally and to embrace the many other types of opportunities to learn and grow at Harvard."
"Widener Library","The Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library - Widener for short - is the hub of the Harvard University Library System, the largest university library system in the world, containing over 28 libraries across 5 countrie. Widener Library is the third largest library in the U.S., behind the Library of Congress and the Boston Public Library. Credit for the building's design belongs to Julian Abele, who was the first African American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's architecture program, and chief designer of the firm who created Widener Library.","Who was Harry Widener?","Harry Widener was a Harvard College student of the Class of 1907. After his graduation, he traveled overseas to collect rare books. In 1912, Harry and his family booked passage home on the infamous Titanic. Unfortunately, Harry's mother Eleanor was the only surviving tamily member of that historic accident. In his will, Harry left his entire book collection to Harvard, and Eleanor funded the construction of Widener Library to house her son's collection, which opened in 1915.","Can the library ever be torn down?","No! Eleanor's donation came with several stipulations. First, she asked that a replica of Harry's study room be built in the center of the library. Additionally, it was written that 'No stone, no brick, no piece of mortar shall be moved-it any part is moved or dismantled, the library will become property of the City of Cambridge.' As a result of this stipulation, and the subsequent need for more space to house a growing collection, there is much more to the library than meets the eye. In addition to the six stories of Widener above ground, the library contains four additional floors of collections that are completely underground."
"Memorial Church","This is the beautiful Memorial Church, standing as a spiritual and commemorative center right here in Tercentenary Theatre. Memorial Church proudly hosts a very long-running non-denominational Sunday service, a tradition in itself. The Church was originally dedicated to Harvard students and alumni who fought and died in World War I. Later, the memorial was expanded to honor World War II, Korean and Vietnam War soldiers.","What's the Church used for?","Memorial Church serves as a spiritual center for the Harvard community, hosting interdenominational Protestant services while welcoming all. It is also importantly a memorial, commemorating Harvard affiliates who gave their lives in various conflicts.","What about the plaque in the front?","When Memorial Church was built, a plaque was installed 'in grateful memory of the Harvard men who died in the World War,' referring to World War I, as no one at the time imagined there would be a second global conflict. If you go inside, you'll see a larger plaque that now lists all Harvard affiliates who gave their lives in various conflicts throughout the 20th century."
"Sever Hall","This red-brick building is Sever Hall, designed by Henry Richardson and completed in the late 1870s. It's a classroom building renowned for its distinctive architectural style - in fact, it was once lauded as a most beautiful building in America! It continues to be used for classes and lectures, embodying a rich architectural heritage that has served generations of students.","What is the 'whispering arch' at Sever Hall?","Sever Hall is known for the 'whispering arch' at its entrance. If you stand at one end of the arch and whisper, someone at the other end can hear you clearly, a fun little quirk of its design.","What architectural style is Sever Hall known for?","Sever Hall is renowned for its Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style. It was designed by the famous architect Henry Hobson Richardson and is considered one of the best examples of his work."
"Wadsworth House","Wadsworth House was built as a presidential home in 1726 for Benjamin Wadsworth, Harvard's eighth president, making it the second oldest building still standing on campus. When General George Washington arrived in Cambridge in July 1775 to assume his command of the Continental Army in the fight against British troops in Boston, he initially used Wadsworth House as his headquarters.","Who else lived here?","Poet Ralph Waldo Emerson boarded in the house when he was a student. The 7th U.S. president Andrew Jackson held a reception of students in the house in 1833 after he received his honorary degree. Later, historian and presidential descendent Henry Adams lived here as an assistant professor. Now, the house hosts foreign dignitaries visiting Harvard.","How does Wadsworth House acknowledge its connection to slavery?","Both President Wadsworth (for whom the house was built) and a later resident, President Edward Holyoke, were slaveholders, and enslaved individuals named Titus, Venus, Bilhah, and Juba lived and worked within Wadsworth House in the early 1700s. In a move to acknowledge this legacy, former Harvard President Drew Faust dedicated a plaque here to their memory."
"Holden Chapel","This small, charming building is Holden Chapel, a true gem in Harvard Yard, dating back to the mid-18th century. It holds the distinction of being one of Harvard's oldest buildings and one of the most venerable college buildings in all of America. Before the larger Memorial Church was constructed, this intimate chapel served as the primary place of worship for the Harvard community. Its distinctive colorful, uniquely shaped façade makes it quite recognizable and architecturally interesting within the Yard. Today, this historic chapel continues to serve the university community, hosting student groups dedicated to vocal performance and thereby continuing its legacy as a place for community and artistic expression at Harvard. Its scale and history offer a peaceful contrast to larger nearby structures.","How old is Holden Chapel?","Holden Chapel was completed in 1744, making it the third oldest building at Harvard and one of the oldest college buildings in all of America.","What is Holden Chapel used for today?","Today, this historic chapel is home to the Holden Choirs, student choral groups, continuing its legacy as a place for community and expression at Harvard."
